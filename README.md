A re-implementation of clojure in clojure.

First iteration will be in java, cleaning up the clojure original implementation, changing a few core abstractions (following clojurescript's footsteps) and moving protocols at the bottom of the bootstrapping process.

After this will implementation will be usable, a second interation will implement everything in pure clojure.

There will be some differences from clojure's implementation, and code that uses clojure.lang.* is expected to break.
